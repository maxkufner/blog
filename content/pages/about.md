co-founder [@ObbyUK](https://obby.co.uk/), former strategy consultant, love @fcbayern &🏌️

This blog was inspired by [Mark Christian](https://writing.markchristian.org/2019/04/29/personal-web-sites/) & [Andrew Chen](https://andrewchen.co/professional-blogging/) to have a place to store all my (currently non-existent) content in one place.

The blog itself runs on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) (+ [Lumen](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen) theme). Feel free to report any bugs [here](https://github.com/maxkufner/blog).
